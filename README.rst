metadata-viewer (BETA)
=======================

Metadata-viewer is a Python  package designed to help you easily visualize
metadata from various file formats mainly for visualizing metadata associated
with cryo-electron microscopy (cryo-EM) data. Its primary functionality includes
displaying data in both table and image gallery modes. This package is capable
of handling large datasets with millions of rows and performing operations such
as selecting and sorting quickly. While its core purpose is to serve as a viewer within the
Scipion framework, it can also be used independently outside of Scipion.
The package facilitates the exploration of cryo-EM-related information and other
types of metadata through efficient data manipulation and visualization, making
it a valuable tool for researchers in the field.
It is available as a small self-contained  `Python module <https://pypi.org/project/metadata-viewer/>`_.
